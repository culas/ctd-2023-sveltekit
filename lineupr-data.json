      "descriptionHtml": "<div>Who uses PowerShell? Who wants to use PowerShell? Who \"has to\" use PowerShell?<br /> <br />Among people developing on Windows, the use of PowerShell (and which version at that) is a contentious topic. Replacing Windows' old batch files (.bat, .cmd, and others to a degree) with a new, arguably innovative and language, the seeming incompatibility with the existing Windows tool landscape and widespread command line tools like Posix-style CLIs, combined with the missing or minimalist (and often lackluster) ghost-doc style documentation certainly didn't help the user experience. Its launch was also not a stellar success, suffering from crashes, missing features and virtually no QOL. Even the promise to access the .NET Framework wasn't received too well by most people.<br /> <br />Allow me to introduce PowerShell 7+ to a skeptical, and potentially scarred, audience. Without delving too much into its history, I will show you how I use \"pwsh\" in a post-dotnet-core world in 2023 as a productivity tool and shell of choice on Windows, Linux (wsl and not), or even macOS. I will cover how I personally use it in conjunction with almost any other CLI I use daily, how to productively integrate it in any application, and how to customize it to your heart's content.<br /> <br />Of course, this talk will also be suited for people who already use/like pwsh to have a peek at how somebody else uses it.</div>",
